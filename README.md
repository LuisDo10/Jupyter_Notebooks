# Jupyter Notebooks
Repository for the managing and version control of the Jupyter Notebooks created as tools for data preparation. The Jupyter Notebooks stored in this repository can either be run in a local machine with a Python distribution installed, or they can be uploaded to the JupyterHub in this address http://35.236.81.152/ and executed there. The JupyterHub is a server created on top of Kubernetes in the Google Cloud, where you can make use of the allocated computational resources to carry out your tasks.
